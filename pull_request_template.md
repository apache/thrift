#### Instructions for Apache Thrift Pull Requests ####

* All code changes require an Apache Jira THRIFT Issue
  (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT)
* Pull requests should contain a single commit per issue, or we will ask you to squash it.
* The pull request title must begin with the Jira THRIFT ticket identifier, for example:

        THRIFT-9999: an example pull request title

* Commit messages must follow this pattern for code changes (deviations will not be merged):

        THRIFT-9999: [summary of fix, one line if possible]
        Client: [language(s) affected, comma separated, use lib/ directory names please]

* Remove these instructions from any pull request description.
