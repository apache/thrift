DOCUMENTATION
----------
Franz, Inc. has online documenation for the URI package upon which
PURI is based:
   http://franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/uri.htm

OVERVIEW
--------
This is portable Universal Resource Identifier library for Common Lisp
programs. It parses URI according to the RFC 2396 specification. It's
is based on Franz, Inc's opensource URI package and has been ported to
work other CL implementations. It is licensed under the LLGPL which
is included in this distribution.

A regression suite is included which uses Franz's open-source tester
library. I've ported that library for use on other CL
implementations. Puri completes 126/126 regression tests successfully.

Franz's unmodified documentation file is included in the file
uri.html. 


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PURI and NET.URI
------------------------------------

* Puri uses the package 'puri while NET.URI uses the package 'net.uri

* To signal an error parsing a URI, Puri uses the condition
  :uri-parse-error while NET.URI uses the condition :parse-error. This
  divergence occurs because Franz's parse-error condition uses
  :format-control and :format-arguments slots which are not in the ANSI
  specification for the parse-error condition.
