Breaking Changes
================

0.12.0
------

The compiler's handling of namespaces when generating the name of types,
functions and header files has been improved. This means code written to use
classes generated by previous versions of the compiler may need to be updated to
reflect the proper convention for class names, which is

- A lowercase, [snake-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
  representation of the class' namespace, followed by
- An underscore and
- A lowercase, snake-case representation of the class' name.
