Testing
-------

D support in Thrift is covered by two sets of tests: first,
the unit test blocks contained in the D source files, and
second, the more extensive testing applications in the test/
subdirectory, which also make use of the Thrift compiler.
Both are built when running "make check", but only the
unit tests are immediately run, however â€“ the separate test
cases typically run longer or require manual intervention.
It might also be prudent to run the independent tests,
which typically consist of a server and a client part,
against the other language implementations.

To build the unit tests on Windows, the easiest way might
be to manually create a file containing an empty main() and
invoke the compiler by running the following in the src/
directory (PowerShell syntax):

dmd -ofunittest -unittest -w $(dir -r -filter '*.d' -name)

Async and SSL
-------------
Using SSL with async is experimental (always has been) and
the unit test "async_test --ssl" hangs.  Use at your own
risk.
