Starting with THRIFT-5021 the need to centralize certain limit settings that are used throughout the whole protocol / transport stack became an obvious need. Previous patches already added some of these limits, but they were not consistently managed and just randomly distributed across the code base. 

# Design goals

Following the tradition of similar experience across languages in Thrift, any implementation should meet these design goals:

 * There MUST be a standard CTOR (or equivalent thereof) that provides a default TConfiguration instance. 
 * The default values used SHOULD be implemented as outlined below.
 * For backwards compatibility, the protocol / transport stack should accept null TConfiguration argument, in which case it should fallback to a default instance automatically. This is to prevent from code-breaking changes as much as possible.

# Implementation

The new TConfiguration class or struct currently holds three settings:

## MaxMessageSize

The MaxMessageSize member defines the maximum size of a (received) message, in bytes. The default value is represented by a constant named DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, whose value is 100 * 1024 * 1024 bytes.

## MaxFrameSize

MaxFrameSize limits the size of one frame of data for the TFramedTransport. Since all implementations currently send messages in one frame only if TFramedTransport is used, this value may interfere with MaxMessageSize. In the case of an conflict, the smaller value of the two is used (see remark below). The default value is called DEFAULT_MAX_FRAME_SIZE and has a value of 16384000 bytes.

## RecursionLimit

The RecursionLimit defines, how deep structures may be nested into each other. The default named DEFAULT_RECURSION_DEPTH allows for structures nested up to 64 levels deep. 

# Further considerations

## MaxFrameSize vs. MaxMessageSize

The difference between the two options is, that MaxFrameSize exists much longer and it is used only in conjunction with TFramedTransport. In contrast, MaxMessageSize is intended to be a general device to be used with any transport or protocol. 

In order to combine both approaches in the most optimal way when using TFramedTransport, it is recommended that the implementation SHOULD update the remaining number of bytes to read based on the received frame size value for the current message.

For calculation purposes it is important to know, that MaxFrameSize excludes the 4 bytes that hold the frame size, while MaxMessageSize is always looking at the whole data. Hence, when updating the remaining read byte count, the known message size should be set to frameSize + sizeof(i32).

## Error handling

If any limit is exceeded, an error should be thrown. Additionally, it may be helpful to check larger memory allocations against the remaining max number of bytes before the allocation attempt takes place.

# Q&A

## Is this a breaking change or not?

There is actually two answers to that question. 

1. If done right, it should not be a breaking change vis-รก-vis compiling your source code that uses Thrift. 

1. It may, however, be a breaking change in the way it limits the accepted overall size of messages or the accepted frame size. This behaviour is by design. If your application hits any of these limits during normal operation, it may require you to instantiate an actual TConfiguration and tweak the settings according to your needs.

## Is splitting the general transport base class into Endpoint and Layered transport base classes necessary?

No, it's not. However, it turned out that this split is a great help when it comes to managing the TConfiguration instance that is passed through the stack. Having two distinct base classes for each of the different transport types not only allows to implement a shared solution for this. 

The added benefit is, that a clear distinction between the two transport types makes the Thrift architectural idea much more clear to "newbie" developers.

## I want to contribute an implementation of TConfiguration and I am not sure whether to pick class or struct?

Short answer: Pick whatever is more efficient in the language of your choice. 

Technically, remember that the instance is passed down the stack and should therefore be cheap on copying. To ensure this and to make sure all pieces of the protocol / transport stack are really pointing to the same TConfiguration instance, we want to pass the instance **by reference** rather than by value. 

For example, in the C# language a class is a suitable choice for this, because classes are naturally reference parameters, while structs are not.
