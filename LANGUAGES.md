# Language Support #

## 0.11.0 (master) ##

These are the language levels tested with every pull request.  The minimum version is tested inside the ubuntu-trusty docker container which is build job #4 in Travis CI, and the maximum is tested inside the ubuntu-xenial docker container which is build job #5 in Travis CI.  Thrift may work for other language levels however we do not regularly test against them.
