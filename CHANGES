Version 0.1.0 RC1 / Unreleased

Compatibility Breaking Changes:
  C++:
    * It's quite possible that regenerating code and rebuilding will be
      required.  Make sure your headers match your libs!

  Java:

  Python:

  Ruby:
    * Generated files now have underscored names [THRIFT-421]
    * The library has been rearranged to be more Ruby-like [THRIFT-276]

  Erlang:
    * Generated code will have to be regenerated, and the new code will
      have to be deployed atomically with the new library code [THRIFT-136]
  
  
New Features and Bug Fixes:
  C++:
    * Support for TCompactProtocol [THRIFT-333]

  Java:
    * Support for TCompactProtocol [THRIFT-110]
