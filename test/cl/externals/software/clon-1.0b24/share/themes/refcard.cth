;;; Commentary:

;; Contents management by FCM version 0.1.

;; This theme provides a "reference card" compact layout. Elements displayed
;; are program synopsis, option syntax and group titles. Neither plain text
;; nor options descriptions appear in the output. Group titles appear in bold
;; font and options are packed together per group.


;;; Code:

:item-separator ", "

:face (synopsis :bold t :padding-bottom 1)

:face (text :hidden t)

:face (option :padding-left 2
	      :face (syntax :item-separator "/"
			    :face (short :item-separator nil)
			    :face (long  :item-separator nil))
	      :face (usage :hidden t))

:face (group :padding-top 0 :padding-bottom 0
