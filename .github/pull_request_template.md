<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->
  

<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->

- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)
- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern "THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue"?
- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)
- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with "Breaking-Change"?
- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.
